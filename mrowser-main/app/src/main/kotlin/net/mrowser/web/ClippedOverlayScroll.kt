/**
 * The edge-scroll fallback for an overlay whose content is cut off by `overflow: hidden`.
 *
 * A consent dialog taller than the TV's 540 CSS px viewport, centred in a fixed
 * `overflow: hidden` box (Quantcast's on antenna.gr, #31), has nothing a wheel can
 * scroll: the box refuses user scrolling, the dialog's own `overflow: auto` text area
 * is never height-constrained so it never overflows, and the wheel falls through to the
 * document behind. Its buttons sit below the screen. A desktop browser reaches them by
 * keyboard focus, which scrolls clipped boxes programmatically; this does the same
 * from the cursor.
 *
 * The cursor is floored to whole CSS px before `elementFromPoint`, which rounds:
 * pinned on the view's last row at 2x density it sits at y = 539.5 of 540, and
 * rounding that up lands outside the page and hits nothing.
 *
 * The script walks out from the element under the cursor the way scroll chaining
 * does. A user-scrollable box with room left is the wheel's job, so it stops there. A
 * clipped box with room left is scrolled by [cssDelta]. It only acts under a
 * `position: fixed` element — an overlay the document can never scroll into view —
 * and the walk ends at that element, so a carousel or a truncated card in the page
 * keeps its clipping, and so does an app root (`height: 100vh; overflow: hidden`)
 * that merely contains a fixed bottom nav. `html` and `body` are left to the wheel
 * too: a scroll-locked page behind a modal stays put.
 * Main frame only (`evaluateJavascript`); a dialog in a cross-origin iframe still
 * relies on the wheel.
